# Deep Neural Network on mnist made in numpy

At the moment the algorithm is using minibatch gradient descent with batch size of 32 reaching 96,9% accuracy on the test set after 100 epochs of training.  
Need to implement gradient checking to see if there are some errors when calculating gradients.  

to run the script run thew following bash:
